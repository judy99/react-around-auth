// utils is a place where you hold functions that are not related to any module or class.
// This is due to the fact that JS is not a strict language. You can use functions, objects, prototypes, classes for the same things.
// Lazy programmers, who can’t split a program into modules clearly, usually place a lot of code into utils. 
// This causes problems when you try to find some function inside a big heap of code.
// So a utils folder or a utils.js should be as smaller as you can.
// Group functions, allocate modules, don’t grow this junkyard)
