# Around the U.S. (Auth with React)

This repository contains a front-end project on React with added authorization and registration features.
Used a previously built front end from Sprint 11 [https://github.com/judy99/around-react].

All authorization, registration and token requests go through to the server running on https://register.nomoreparties.co.

## Routes
  * `/signup` — for user registration
  * `/signin` — for user authorization
  * `/` - for authorized users only
